<p>“Success isn't about how much money you make; it's about the difference you make in people's lives.”</p>
<a href="https://www.biography.com/us-first-lady/michelle-obama">Michelle Obama</a> has made an image for herself beyond <em>being the president's wife.</em><p>Michelle Obama's message on measuring success is one that I will continue to carry with me as I enter the workforce to stay humble and never forget why and where I started, especially when times get tough.</p>
